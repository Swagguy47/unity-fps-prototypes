"ArcticGame"

*I cannot ensure all dependancies are included, additional packages may need to be installed*

# -Gist of the game-
A singleplayer sandbox shooter title, where the player joins in large military battles that span large sized environments set in the arctic. The catch being that every character on screen (so long as they were on of the same team) was playable, and you could swap between them at will instantly. Each soldier you could swap between would be designated a specific class, and the missions of the campaign would progress whether or not the player actually won or lost, which was determined by the side first capable of depleting the enemy soldier population within a threshold. The player would be briefed how well their side performed after completing the entire campaign, of which it'll show stats like kills, deaths, and depending on whether they won or lost a majority of the missions, whether they won the war.
