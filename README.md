"CanoeGame"

*I cannot ensure all dependancies are included, additional packages may need to be installed*

# -Gist of the game-
A singleplayer story-driven game with lite survival mechanics. Set in a dystopian future where climate change has flooded the natural environment, forcing the remaining humans to build giant walls around their cities to prevent them from being submerged. Outraged for an unknown reason, the robot servants revolted against their masters, becoming extremely hostile and effectively banishing all humans in a city to leave, most did just that leaving with ships, but not all were lucky and some were left behind. You are a young adult girl named "Sasha", tasked with the monumental objective of finishing your recently deceased father's makeshift super raft, finally capable of leaving the slums built around the city walls and passing the rough current beyond to salvation. You must scavenge parts and seek help from strangers in a weird and divided future. A nearby cult, a recently constructred pier, a sector infected with a deadly virus, and a market hub are the main locations to explore.

# -Additional notes-
CanoeGame was built ontop of the ArcticGame framework after it's cancellation, due to this you will notice a lot of leftover assets or similar functionality, especially within the `depot/Assets/OldAssets/` directory. I cannot ensure full compatibility with leftover content if spawned in game.

Long after the end of development, this project was later revisted for use as a prototyping platform for a completely unrelated game while another person was busy making changes to it's project. This explains the out-of-place low poly, sci-fi prototype items and test level.
